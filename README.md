# Trap the Cat (or Triad): Pd Vanilla Edition [Purr Data GSoC 2024]

This is a two-in-one game built with Pd vanilla's data structures and Pd-lua https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua. Place tiles on the board to encircle the cat, which is always trying to move towards the edge. In the chord mode, the "cat" is a triadic chord moving on a Tonnetz board (tone network). Click on tones that neighbor the chord to trap it. The music adapts to the current harmonic state.
Chase the chord around to influence the harmonic progression!
